**Ingredients:**

\- 2 cups all-purpose flour 

\- 1 teaspoon salt 

\- 2 eggs 

\- 2 tablespoons butter, melted 

\- 1/2 cup water, plus more if needed 

\- 1/2 pound ground pork or beef

\- 1 teaspoon dried marjoram 

\- 1 teaspoon garlic powder 

\- Salt and pepper to taste

**Method:**

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, melted butter and water together. 

2. Slowly add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, stirring with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together. If the dough is too dry, add a little more water. 

3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside.
