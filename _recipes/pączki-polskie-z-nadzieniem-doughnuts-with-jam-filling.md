# **LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY:**

Polish doughnuts with jam filling are quite difficult to make. They require a lot of time, skill, and patience to get them just right. The dough needs to be kneaded carefully, shaped and deep fried at the right temperature. The jam filling needs to be carefully prepared and the doughnuts need to be filled and sealed with finesse. All in all, it's a labor of love that requires a level of expertise, thereofre I would rate it as a 5 on a scale of 1-5.

## **INGREDIENTS:**

\- 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour 

\- 1 teaspoon baking powder 

\- ¼ teaspoon salt

\- ½ cup white sugar 

\- 2 eggs 

\- ¾ cup milk 

\- 2 tablespoons melted butter 

\- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 

\- Jam of your choice 

### **METHOD:**

1. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. 
2. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, melted butter, and vegetable oil. 
3. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and mix until well combined. 
4. On a lightly floured surface, roll out dough to a ¼-inch thick. 
5. Cut out doughnuts with a doughnut cutter or a biscuit cutter. 
6. Heat a few inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
7. Fry doughnuts for about 1 minute per side, or until golden brown. 
8. Remove from oil and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

**WAIT FOR THEM TO COOL AND ENJOY. SERVE WITH WHITE SUGAR!**
