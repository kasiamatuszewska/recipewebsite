**LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY:**

I would rate the recipe for Kotlet Schabowy (Breaded Pork Cutlet) a 3 out of 5 in difficulty. It isn't overly complicated, but it does require patience, precision, and attention to detail. The most challenging part is getting the breading just right. You need to make sure the pork is evenly and thoroughly coated with the breading before you cook it. It also requires a bit of flipping and turning to ensure that the pork cooks through evenly. The end result is definitely worth it, though!

**INGREDIENTS:**

\- 4 boneless pork cutlets, pounded thin 

\- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour 

\- 2 large eggs, beaten 

\- 1 cup bread crumbs 

\- 1 teaspoon garlic powder 

\- 2 tablespoons olive oil 

\- Salt and pepper, to taste 

**METHOD:**

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
2. Place the pork cutlets between two pieces of wax paper and pound until they are 1/4 inch thick. 
3. Place the flour, beaten eggs, and bread crumbs in separate shallow bowls. 
4. In the bowl with the bread crumbs, add the garlic powder, salt, and pepper. 
5. Dip each cutlet first in the flour, then the egg, then the bread crumb mixture. 
6. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
7. Place the cutlets in the skillet and cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. 
8. Transfer the cutlets to a baking sheet and place in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.
9. Serve warm with a side of mashed potatoes or a fresh salad.

**ENJOY!**
